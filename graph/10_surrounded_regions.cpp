PROBLEM: Surrounded Regions (LeetCode 130)
Difficulty: Medium
Pattern: DFS/BFS from Boundary

DESCRIPTION:
Capture all regions that are surrounded by 'X'. A region is captured by flipping
all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
A region is surrounded if it's not connected to the boundary.

GRID DIAGRAM:
  Input:          Output:
  X X X X         X X X X
  X O O X   -->   X X X X  (Inner O's are surrounded)
  X X O X         X X X X
  X O X X         X O X X  (Bottom O touches boundary - safe)

  O's connected to boundary edges are safe
  O's completely surrounded by X's are captured (flipped to X)

APPROACH:
1. Start DFS/BFS from all 'O's on the boundary
2. Mark all boundary-connected 'O's as safe (change to temporary marker)
3. Flip all remaining 'O's to 'X' (these are surrounded)
4. Restore safe 'O's back to 'O'

TIME COMPLEXITY: O(M * N)
SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(M * N) for recursion stack

/*
INPUT:
X X X X
X O O X
X X O X
X O X X

OUTPUT:
X X X X
X X X X
X X X X
X O X X

EXPLANATION:
- The 'O' at (3,1) is connected to boundary, so it remains 'O'
- The 'O's at (1,1), (1,2), (2,2) are surrounded, so they become 'X'
